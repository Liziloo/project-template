# Core

The core contains all domain logic.

Rules:
- plain JavaScript only
- no UI concerns
- no framework imports
- no environment-specific assumptions
- no direct knowledge of adapters

If this folder is deleted, the project has no meaning.
If everything else is deleted, the project should still make sense.
